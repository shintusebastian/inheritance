Dependencies in Java can be managed using Maven :
They are extra java classes combined as a jar. jar is a collection of classes. We need extra classes that are not part of JDK
library. we will need to add those jars within our class path(project).
If we are using a Maven project, we just mention the dependency tag (just google from the maven repository) and our job is done.
in a Maven project, pom is the place where you add dependencies and plugins.
after adding a dependency or plugin, we need to do "mvn clean install" command prompt.
